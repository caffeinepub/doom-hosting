  "summary": "The diff implements server creation flow fixes with redirect loop prevention, loading states, error handling, and proper Stripe checkout flow. All three requirements (REQ-9, REQ-10, REQ-11) are addressed with comprehensive implementation including provisioning state management, user feedback mechanisms, and duplicate submission prevention.",

    {
      "description": "Added visual provisioning state to ServerCard component with animated spinner and 'Provisioning...' text display",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest does not mention updating the ServerCard component or displaying provisioning status within server cards. REQ-11 only requests loading/error states on the creation button, not on individual server cards after creation.",

      "description": "Disabled 'Manage Server' button during provisioning state in ServerCard",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest focuses on the server creation button behavior and states. Disabling the 'Manage Server' button for provisioning servers was not requested.",

    {
      "description": "Added fixed overlay with loading card during server processing",
      "reason": "While REQ-11 requires loading states on the button, the implementation adds a full-screen backdrop overlay with a processing card. This goes beyond the requested button-level loading state.",
